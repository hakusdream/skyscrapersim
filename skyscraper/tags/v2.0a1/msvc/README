This directory contains MSVC version 6 and 7 project files for
Skyscraper.

If the project files become outdated, you can re-generate them by invoking
"jam msvcgen". Copy the generated files from the build subdirectory `out/msvc'
to `skyscraper/msvc'.

MSVC6 project and workspace files (.dsp and .dsw) must be committed to a CVS
repository as "binary" files.  For example: `cvs add -kb *.dsp *.dsw'.
Generated .rc files and all MSVC7 project and solution files can be committed
as plain text.  For example: `cvs add *.rc *.vcproj *.sln'.

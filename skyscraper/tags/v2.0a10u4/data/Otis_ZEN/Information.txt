Otis ZEN Fixture Set
Feel free to use this fixture. You don't have to give a credit.

Chimes:
-OtisZEN_ArriveChime.wav is supposed to sound when the lanterns appear, and the NewOtisChime2.wav is supposed to sound when the doors open.
-Skyscraper doesn't support double-stage chimes yet, although you can use them in elevator animations.
-OtisZEN_ArriveChime.wav only plays if there are lanterns (If you want to use them in elevator animations). For outside lanterns, you can use Otis Series 3 lanterns (No arrow version).
 Note: Please put in both lanterns and indicators outside.

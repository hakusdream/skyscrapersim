Automatic Floor Sign Generator for the GIMP
by Ryan Thoryk, 12/2008

This folder contains scripts for the GIMP on Linux for easily creating
floor signs.  To use it, just put the makesigns.scm file into your gimp scripts directory (for GIMP 2.4 it would be ~/.gimp-2.4/scripts) and run the "run.sh" script by typing "./run.sh".  It will create signs numbered from 1 to 150, and also misc signs in the current directory.

Configuration options are in both the makesigns.scm file and the run.sh script.

Font sizes used:
sans: 64, 38 for others
sans bold: 60, 36 for others
sans condensed: 64, 46 for others
sans bold condensed: 64, 44 for others

Automatic Floor Sign Generator for the GIMP
by Ryan Thoryk, 12/2008

This folder contains scripts for the GIMP on Linux for easily creating
floor signs.  To use it, just put the makesigns.scm file into your gimp scripts directory (for GIMP 2.4 it would be ~/.gimp-2.4/scripts) and run the "run.sh" script by typing "./run.sh".  It will create signs numbered from 1 to 300, and also misc signs in the current directory.  The run2.sh script creates the elevator operational buttons.

Configuration options are in both the makesigns.scm file and the two run scripts.

Font sizes used:
sans: 64, 38 for elevator buttons
sans bold: 60, 36 for elevator buttons
sans condensed: 64, 46 for elevator buttons
sans bold condensed: 64, 44 for elevator buttons

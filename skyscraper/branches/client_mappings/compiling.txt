Skyscraper OGRE version source build instructions for Debian Linux
-------------------------------------

Install required stuff:

Debian 8:
---
sudo apt-get install subversion cmake gcc g++ gcc-doc wx3.0-headers libwxgtk3.0-dev freeglut3-dev zlib1g-dev libfreeimage-dev libfreetype6-dev libois-dev libzzip-dev libxaw7-dev libxrandr-dev x11proto-randr-dev nvidia-cg-toolkit libgtk2.0-dev libboost-dev cmake-curses-gui
---

If you have a multi-core system, at the step that says to type "make", you can instead type "make -j2" to build using 2 cores, or "make -j4" for 4 cores.

Step 1 - build and install Bullet
----------
Get Bullet source (my custom-patched version):
---
wget http://www.skyscrapersim.com/downloads/dev/other_apps/bullet.tar.bz2
---

Extract Bullet:
---
tar xfvj bullet.tar.bz2
---

Build and install Bullet:
---
cd bullet-svn
cmake -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS=-fPIC -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=-fPIC -DINSTALL_EXTRA_LIBS=ON -DBUILD_DEMOS=OFF -DUSE_DOUBLE_PRECISION=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make
sudo make install
cd
---

If you want to play around with the Bullet demos, remove the "-DBUILD_DEMOS=OFF" portion when running cmake above and then build it.


Step 2 - install the FMOD sound system
----------
Get the related Linux package from:
http://www.fmod.org/download/

(Get the FMOD Studio Programmer's API for Linux)
---
tar xfvz fmodstudioapi10703linux.tar.gz
cd fmodstudioapi10703linux/api/lowlevel
sudo mkdir /usr/local/include/fmod
sudo cp -a inc/* /usr/local/include/fmod/
sudo cp -a lib/x86_64/* /usr/local/lib/
cd
---


Step 3 - build and install OGRE
-----------

First get the source:
---
wget http://www.skyscrapersim.com/downloads/dev/other_apps/ogre_src_1.9-skyscraper.tar.bz2
tar xfvj ogre_src_1.9-skyscraper.tar.bz2
cd ogre-1.9
cmake -DOGRE_CONFIG_DOUBLE=ON -DOGRE_BUILD_SAMPLES=OFF -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make
sudo make install
cd
---

(if you want to install the OGRE samples, for the cmake line above do "cmake -DINSTALL_SAMPLES=ON" instead)

On an Ubuntu 14.04 test system, the "cmake" command was failing for Ogre due to an issue with Freetype.  This line fixes the issue:
---
cmake -DFREETYPE_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/include/freetype2 -DOGRE_BUILD_SAMPLES=OFF -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
---


Step 4 - build and install Caelum (sky system)
-----------
This one you can pull from SVN, and I have custom-modified source code.
So pull the source from SVN, and build:

---
svn co http://svn.tliquest.net/skyscraper/caelum/trunk caelum
cd caelum
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make
sudo make install
cd
---


Step 5 - build and install the Ogre Procedural Geometry library
-----------
This is a new addition, and I have custom-modified source in SVN.
So pull the source from SVN, and build:

---
svn co http://svn.tliquest.net/skyscraper/ogre-procedural ogre-procedural
cd ogre-procedural
cmake .
make
sudo make install
---


Step 6 - build Skyscraper (this also builds the built-in OgreBullet libraries)
-----------
First grab the source via SVN, and build.

---
svn co http://svn.tliquest.net/skyscraper/skyscraper/trunk skyscraper
cd skyscraper
wget http://www.skyscrapersim.com/downloads/dev/other_apps/plugins.cfg
cmake .
make
---

Finally, run Skyscraper:
---
./skyscraper
---

To update the app in the future, first do an SVN update, rebuild and run:
---
svn update
./svnrev.sh
make
./skyscraper
---

If any files were added in SVN, you'll have to run Cmake before the "make" command, or else it'll have linking errors:
---
svn update
./svnrev.sh
cmake .
make
./skyscraper
---

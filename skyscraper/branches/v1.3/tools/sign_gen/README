Automatic Floor Sign Generator for the GIMP
by Ryan Thoryk, 12/2008

This folder contains scripts for the GIMP on Linux for easily creating
floor signs.  To use it, just put the makesigns.scm file into your gimp
scripts directory (for GIMP 2.4 it would be ~/.gimp-2.4/scripts) and run
the "run.sh" script with a number option specifying the font (explained below). To use the standard font (Sans), run it by typing "./run.sh 1".  It will
create signs numbered from 1 to 300, misc signs, and elevator operational
buttons.  It will then automatically create the zip archive containing the
signs; simply copy this zip file into Skyscraper's "data" directory.

Configuration options are in both the makesigns.scm file and the run.sh script.

Font sizes used, and their number:
1: sans: 64, 38 for elevator buttons
2: sans bold: 60, 36 for elevator buttons
3: sans condensed: 64, 46 for elevator buttons
4: sans bold condensed: 64, 44 for elevator buttons
